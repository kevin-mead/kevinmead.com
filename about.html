  Kevin is the director of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uploader.network" target="_blank">Uploader Network</a>, an organization formed from the community of the now-deleted Instagram page <a href="https://www.uploadforfree.com/goodbye" target="_blank">Upload For Free</a>. Its mission is to explore the complex dynamics related to the “uploader” class. Uploader Network hosted a week-long artist retreat at Griffis Sculpture Park in East Otto, NY in August 2024, and the group art show “Happy Birthday, Upload For Free” at The Living Gallery in Brooklyn, NY in October 2024.
